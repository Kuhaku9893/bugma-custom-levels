# BugMa Custom Levels
Custom levels I made for the game バグと魔法使い.

#### To install and play:

1. Make sure that you have cleared the game (100 stages) and unlocked "Debug Room".
2. For level `j` of room `i`: copy the level file `customstage${i}-${j}.txt` to the folder `BugMa_Data` inside the game directory, and rename it to `customstage.txt`. For example, for level 1-1, copy the file `customstage1-1.txt` and rename it to `customstage.txt`.
   - You may want to keep a copy of the original `customstage.txt` before overwriting it.

3. Start the game. The level is at "デバッグルーム" - "カスタムステージ".

Enjoy!

#### Troubleshooting

If a level does not load, please make sure that there are at least 2 empty lines after the map in the `customstage.txt` file.
